A simple game of blackjack where the deck is unlimited.

When running the project you will be given 2 cards and shown 1 card from the computer player.

You will then have the option of 'y' to have another card dealt or 'n' to stick with what you have.

Any other inputs for this will throw an error.

If you go over 21 you lose.

The two scores are compared and if the computer score is better than your score, providing it is under 21 then you lose.

If your score is better than the computers score, providing it is under 21 you win.

You are then presented with the option to play again 'y' resets the game and gives you new cards, 'n' ends the game.

Any other input will throw an error and end the game
